# pandas-challenge

The goal of this challenge was to use Pandas coding in order to analyse the data of the math and reading scores of a variety of schools in order to identify if there are certain identifying charactoristics for the schools that produce higher or lower student scores.

Files included in this challenge: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv

Dependancies used: pandas

My analysis and conclusions are located at the top of the analysis Notebook.

My main takeaway from this project is that both Pandas is a powerful and very useful tool to use in order to organize and summarize data. It allows me to create easy to use coding options in order to summarize the data in a concise, easy to read and analyse format.

The most difficult challenge I had with this assignment was in the binning portion as my data analysis provided slightly different values than what was given. I tried a couple alternative methods to find this data but they all had the same result. 

Overall I found this homework challenge defintely pushed my Pandas knowledge and coding abilities to a new level.
